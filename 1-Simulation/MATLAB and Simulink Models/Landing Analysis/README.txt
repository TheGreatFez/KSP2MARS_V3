Simulink Model Readme:

The simulink model we are going to be using is something I (TheGreatFez) have been using for a while and developed it for the original KSP2MARS projects. 

To get started, the simulation model is "NewOrbitSimulation". You will need Simulink to open the model.

When it runs it opens the "PlanetSelect.m" file to load parameters. I suggest looking through there to start. It is not commented very well but its a start.

You can then just open the model and run the simulation. I have two plotting scripts "PlotInertial" and "PlotPlanetRelative". After running the simulations you should be able to plot them and see this is a launch simulation.
